to run the backend just do nodemon index.js
You'll then need to open the link yourself however http://localhost:3000/

to add to the backend post with this url (localhost:3000/api/user/register)  in postman with this body (raw, json):
{
	"name": <whatever name you want>,
	"email": <whatever email you want>,
	"password" : <the password>
}
